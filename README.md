# github-avatar-generator

I was finding a GitHub style avatar generator to replace my boring avatar and I was out of luck. So I made this web tool for anyone like me who want to design their own GitHub-like avatar.

## Technologies

Made with Preact using domtoimage, file-saver and react-colorful. Hosted on Vercel.

## CLI Commands

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# test the production build locally
npm run serve

# run tests with jest and enzyme
npm run test
```
